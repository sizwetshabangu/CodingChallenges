# Coding Challenges

## Purpose
This project serves to show all the codding challenges I have completed. These include coding challenges from HackerRank, Codility and LeetCode. 

These are not the best solutions to these challenges, but they are my interpretation of them during the time. The challenges include tests(Hopefully) and originally passed when ran on the respective websites.

## Code Quality
These solutions vary in quality depending on the time I spent on them, so they do not necessarily show my coding capabilities nor best coding practices.

## Optimised Code
Most of the challenges are not optimised they are my interpretation during the time

## Warranty
Even though this code has some tests to ensure that it works as intended there are no guarantees that it will work to solve the solutions in the future, and it should be taken at your own peril.

## Contribution Guidelines
I would welcome changes to any of these but since they are for my own practice and have nothing to do with correctness or optimisation, I would recommend using the aforementioned sites to test out your abilities.
